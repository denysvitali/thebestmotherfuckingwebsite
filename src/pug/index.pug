  h1 This is the #[i best] motherfucking website.
  p.st Really, it is.
  h2 Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?
  p You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite](.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
  p #[span.wr WRONG], motherfucker.
  h2 The best kick-ass website
  p Let me describe the #[i real] perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite]s:
  ul
    li Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 16.86 KB when the 73KB cat picture below is removed)
    li The page weighs 90.36KB, 87.47% less than the #[a(href="https://google.com/") Google home page]
    li Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (altough it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)
    li Looks #[i almost] the same on every screen
    li Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem #[small well, kind of]
    li Shit is #[i even more] legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET") ARPANET] website
    li Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers") IPoAC]
    li Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans"
    li It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
    li Doesn't include any tracking service #[small this website does, but hey, who cares]
    li Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available #[i JUST USE IT].
    li Use #[i some] fucking #[span#rbw.colored colors].
    li Links don't really need to keep that #[span.sb shitty blue] the browser is giving them: nor that #[span.sv violetish color] when they are marked as visited. Just give them a #[a(href="http://www.colorhexa.com/2980b9") nice color]
  h2 Well guess what, motherfucker:
  p This website is even better than the last #[a(href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com") guy] and the #[a(href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/") guy before him].
  p Why?
  ul
    li It's over a #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS") secure connection] - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).
    li It uses one of the most general #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD") gTLDs] available out there: .website
    li It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out #[a(href="http://domainr.com/") domainr] to do something cool too.
    li It uses the kickassing #[a(href="https://letsencrypt.org/") Let's Encrypt] CA (don't you see the green lock?)
    li It runs on #[a(href="https://nginx.com/") nginx]: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server
    li It uses #[a(href="js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js") a custom version] of the awesome #[a(href="http://jquery.com/") ultra-lightweight jQuery] #[b /s]
    li It doesn't use a single media query #[small well, not really]
    li It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from #[a(href="https://microsoft.com/ie") the crap he uses] to #[a(href="https://mozilla.com/firefox") a much cooler browser]
    li It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript #[img(src="img/js.svg")], CSS3 #[img(src="img/css3.svg")] and HTML5 #[img(src="img/html5.svg")]
    li It's Open Source and on #[a(href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/") Github].
  h2 Put even more contrast
  p Yeah, a #[span.foufoufou #444 is cool] and a #[span.fivfivfiv #555 is worse].
  p We need to be nice to our eyes while looking at a #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite].
  h2 Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate
  p Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either. Just be crisp and clear, motherfucker.
  h2 Put some pictures
  .fancyPositioning
    .picture-left
      img(src="img/cat.jpg")
      p.caption A cat, just to keep the context of the website.
    .tleft
      p We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite] so include some pictures to give a context.
      p The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.
      p You see that fancy cat? He's happy, so should you.

  h2 Yes, even this is satire.
  p But this doesn't mean you should load your #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite] with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!
  blockquote
    span Good design is as little design as possible.
    author Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com
  p That's not entirely true, look at that #[span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite]. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.

  h2 Epilogue
  p Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the #[a(href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"): span.mfw motherfuckingwebsite] and the #[a(href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"): span.mfw bettermotherfuckingwebsite].
  p Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still #[span.mfw thebestmotherfuckingwebsite]), so go check 'em out.
  p Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" #[span.citneed Cit. needed]
  h2 Author
  p This website was created by an annoyed developer that can #[a(href="https://twitter.com/DenysVitali") be followed on Twitter], #[a(href="https://github.com/denysvitali/") followed on GitHub] or contacted #[a(href="https://denv.it/") here, on his ultra-minimalist website]
  h2 Resources
  p The cat picture was taken from the cool #[a(href="https://pixabay.com/") Pixabay] website (check it out, it's really cool and full of CC0 content). The author is #[a(href="https://pixabay.com/en/users/aloiswohlfahrt-123449/") aloiswohlfahrt]
